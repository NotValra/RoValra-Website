# API Terms of Use

**Last Updated:** August 15, 2025

## Introduction
Welcome, developer! The RoValra API is a non-profit passion project created to enhance the Roblox experience, primarily through our [RoValra Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rovalra-roblox-improved/njcickgebhnpgmoodjdgohkclfplejli).

These terms ensure a fair and sustainable environment for all users. By accessing or using our API, you agree to be bound by them.

## Permitted Use

You are free to use the RoValra API for your projects under the following conditions:
*   **Attribution:** You must provide clear attribution to RoValra in your project. A simple "Powered by RoValra" with a link to our website (https://rovalra.com) is sufficient.
*   **User-Agent:** We strongly recommend identifying your application by setting a custom User-Agent header for all API requests (e.g., `MyAwesomeProject/1.0; contact@example.com`). This helps us identify traffic and contact you if needed.
*   **Rate Limiting:** You must respect the API rate limits. Abusing the API may result in a temporary or permanent block.
*   **Caching and Efficiency:** Our API responses are cached for a minimum of 60 seconds. You must implement your application to respect this by caching responses on your end and avoiding unnecessary or excessive requests.
*   **Non-Commercial Use:** The API is provided for non-commercial use only. For commercial inquiries, please contact us to discuss a partnership.

## Prohibited Use
You may not use the API for any of the following purposes:
*   In any project or application that violates the [Roblox Terms of Service](https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004647846-Roblox-Terms-of-Use), regardless of whether the API itself is used for the violating action.
*   For any form of data scraping, data mining, or mass data collection.
*   To reverse-engineer or attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems.
*   To create a service that directly competes with the RoValra extension without our express written permission. A service is considered to be in direct competition if it replicates features that use our API in a way that is substantially similar to the RoValra extension, to the point where it could be considered a functional replacement by a typical user. This restriction does not apply to features that are novel or were implemented in your project before they appeared in RoValra.
*   To resell, sublicense, or redistribute data obtained from the API without our express written permission.
*   In any project that creates or distributes malware, spyware, or other malicious software.

## Right to Revoke Access

We reserve the right to revoke your access to the API and/or demand the removal of the API from your project or application at any time, for any reason, or for no reason, with or without prior notice. This includes, but is not limited to, violations of these Terms of Use or any applicable laws or regulations.

## Disclaimer of Warranties

The RoValra API is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE," without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee that the API will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. You use the API at your own risk.

## Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, RoValra and its developers shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill resulting from your use of, or inability to use, the API.

## Changes to Terms

We may update these terms from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the new terms on this page. Your continued use of the API after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new terms.
